# WarChess_MultiplayerTest
This is a unity multiplayer test project using Lobby and Relay. 

The goal is to implement a chess game that can be played over the internet. 
The project will further serve as a playground for new code structures and packages.

Feel free to contact me if you want to use some of the code in this project. I have chosen not to add a license to this repository as it is supposed to end up as a full commercially viable game - plan on having fun experimenting with chess variation - but most useful code will eventually end up in an open source package.
